<h>Vulgarity Dictionary</h>
<p>A normal dictionary is pretty useless for most words. For most native speakers of American, they are more concerned with grammar and other things because defintions are easy and picked up by context. What is not easy, however, is picking good words. My idea is to make a dictionary that gives words based on how vulgar you are allowed to be in that situation. It will rank words on scale from a (quite predictable) 1 to 10 (1 being safest words, 10 being most vulgar). This could help people understand the positives and negatives of using some words, and it could ultimately be a helpful tool to assist writing. The real power of this tool is giving possible words that have the same meaning as something, but fall into another category of vulgarity. With this ability, people would better know how to use their words in a more fitting way during speech and writing. Maybe that could replace "fucking" as the usual word of choice for people. Another thing about this scale that has to work is the context. "Bomb" is not a bad word, but if you scream it in the middle of a resturant or movie theater, it can cause some serious damage. I haven't figured out too much of the logistics of this yet, but that is what I thought of so far.</p>
