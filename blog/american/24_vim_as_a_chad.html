<h>VIM as a Chad</h>
<p>I am moving up in the Linux elitism hierarchy. I am starting to use VIM the correct way. I used to be a soydev that uses the arrow keys, but now I am using the HJKL setup. It is very optimal with editing, but I am still getting used to it. I imagine it will be hard to go back to not using the stuff on VIM, like in school. Whatever, it is just my thing.</p>
