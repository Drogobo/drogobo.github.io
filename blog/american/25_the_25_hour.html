<h>The 25th Hour</h>
<p>I had 6 hours to do literally nothing today, so I decided to watch some comprehensible input. One of the videos I watched was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlDtTlyAuKo">hour long livestream</a> that, despite not having as many guides and tools, was still more comprehensible than some of the other videos. I have a few more hour-long livestreams I have to watch, so I will have A LOT more content to watch. The good thing about being in the beginner videos is that the videos are more entertaining. I am also starting to gain intuition for a lot of words, but I don't think this would be possible if I studied Spanish instead of acquiring it.</p>
