<h>Spanish Comprehensible Input</h>
<p>Today, I am giving a much more relaxed article than yesterday. This is the 2nd article here (yay), and I want to talk about something I have been doing for a bit. I started trying to learn Spanish using only comprehensible input. Well, asterik on only. I have to take Spanish class this year, and it really messes with the comprehensible input. Thanks to the way school is set up, I will probably forget all the vocab I learned from the class, and I could replace it the comprehensible input vocab. I am watching <a href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/">Dreaming Spanish</a>'s videos for the comprehensible input. I really recommend them, because their input is very comprehensible. I watched another comprehensible input series for 29 days, doing one video a day. However, these videos ended up being incomprehensible input, because I couldn't understand the story most of the time. They got more odd and harder to follow as the videos went on. I am very happy with <a href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/">Dreaming Spanish</a> videos because they are always comprehensible. I would recommend giving their videos a shot if you want to learn Spanish. Also, today I got the <a href="https://drogobo.com">drogobo.com</a> domain. The domain really makes me feel like I am doing something other than writing weird blog posts that nobody will read. It compels me to write more entries. How many times should I make these a week? There is no comment section, so I guess that is a rhetorical question. I want to write another one in toki pona tomorrow, but I don't know what to write it on.</p>
