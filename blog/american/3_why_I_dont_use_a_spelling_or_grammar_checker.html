<h>Why I Don't Use a Spelling or Grammar Checker</h>
<p>I would like to dedicate an article to this question. I don't like grammar or spelling, and why should I? It does not make a difference to say "less" instead of "fewer". Nobody on earth, except really annoying people, will not understand what I have said. That is to say, grammar is usually completely irrelavant if people can understand what you are saying. For example, I will sometimes make things that should be plural (ending in s) into something that is not plural (chopping off s). This has not affected (there is another tricky grammar thing, affect vs. effect) how people understand the words I am saying. Grammar is a messy thing, and to make an entire application that polices your grammar makes no sense. I get it if you are trying to write a school paper or make a resum√©, but that is only because it is expect to use this "standard" grammar. If there is only going to be one grammar, then nothing can change. We need to think more open-minded about our language. Thankfully, American does not have a specific arbiter of grammar. Only the people can decide what can change, but even with that, there are still so many people who want to call out insignificant grammar rules. When people say "your" instead of "you're", it isn't the end of the world. If you heard it spoken aloud, chances are that you would know the meaning of it. Don't even get started on spelling. Spelling in American is an abomination due to the blatant inconsistencies that exist in every word's spelling. Some are pronounced exactly like you would think. "Cat" is a word that a child learning the alphabet could spell because the deduction is easy. On the other hand, "one" is a spelling abomination. There is no "w", o isn't even the right vowel, and then "e" at the end is silent. Way to go, "one"! You <strong>won</strong> the spelling bee! The summary is that there is just no reason for me to use a spell-checker. I am a dude with a bit of free-time and a computer. This isn't a news website, so I don't have to type anything professional.</p>
