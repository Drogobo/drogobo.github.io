<h>Update on Spanish Input</h>
<p>Since the last article, I think I gained about 5 or 6 hours of input. It is easy to gain hours, because all I have to do is sit and watch <a href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/">Dreaming Spanish</a> videos. I really like Pablo's videos, so I watch those exclusively. This experience, gaining the input, is very fun. I will start to crosstalk with people when I have 10 hours (which is 3 hours extra). I watch ~38 minutes a day of input, which I keep track of with the website. This experience makes me want to create a sequel to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm"><em>o pilin e toki pona</em></a>, maybe about 10 more 20 minute videos that will include the the nimi ku suli (he only used nimi pu) and unpa (he specifically used unpa one time).</p>
