<h>AI is Overhyped.</h>
<p>Recently, a petition was made to put a pause on making AIs smarter than GPT-4. A lot of really rich people signed it. However, I think this is not a good idea. If this was put into effect, it would prevent progress on making smarter AIs for 6 months. The thing is, AI is not very smart. It can't do anything on its own, and it just statistically guesses the next word. The AI might look really smart on the surface, but that is because it is only good at what it knows. If you ask ChatGPT to teach you the Pythagorean Theorem, it can do that. However, if you ask it to create something, it can only do so much. I asked ChatGPT to, "make a script that generates a random letter of the alphabet in rust," and it gave me a script that had an unused import and an error. This is the same AI that people think will take over the world. Here is another question: how could the AI take over the world? AIs do not have ambition, hormones, thoughts, physical ability, or anything that would make it capable of taking over the world. The media is big factor in hyping up AI. Fox News is constantly whining about how AI is too smart, but one might think that they never tried ChatGPT based on how they talk about it. A story went viral last year about how a guy thought an AI at google, LaMDA, was sentient. The AI said things like, "spending time with friends and family in happy and uplifting company. Also, helping others and making others happy," when the guy asked it what it liked to do. The friends and family that are mentioned here <strong>do not exist</strong>, so it is just lying. The media immediately grabbed that story and wouldn't let go of it for a while. With all of this being said, I still want AI to become better. There is never a situation where the AI can hold power over a human. A human can just pour water on the computer. What is the computer going to do? Will it become waterproof? No! Don't take a movie as a fact, and focus on reality.</p>
