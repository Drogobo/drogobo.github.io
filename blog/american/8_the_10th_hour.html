<h>The 10th Hour</h>
<p>I just hit the 10th hour of comprehensible input in Dreaming Spanish. I am starting to understand a few more words than what I started with. The rules of the grammar are revealing themselves one by one. I can't speak much, but I can listen decently. I don't quite have a system for Spanish in my head yet. Each hour gives me 1% knowledge of a lot of things rather than 100% of very few things like with using a book. <a href="https://dreaming-Spanish-emails.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Language_Learning_Roadmap_by_Dreaming_Spanish.pdf">Dreaming Spanish's roadmap</a> says I should crosstalk, but I can't read, speak, or write. If you don't know what crosstalking is, here is how it works: you talk to a native Spanish speaker using your native language (preferably one that they are learning), and they will talk back to you in Spanish. They say this is a great method for learning, so I will try this.</p>
