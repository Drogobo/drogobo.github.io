<h>Why I Call it "American"</h>
<p>A lot of people ask when they read my stuff or hear me talk about why I call it "American". They usually think that I am trying to say "English", but that is simply untrue. In American, we spell things in an easier way. For a few examples, we spell color instead of colour, realize instead of realise, favorite instead of favourite, cookie instead of biscuit, labeling instead of labelling, and so many more. My point is, we are not in Europe, so we are not speaking English. People will usually counter with something about how the United States does not have a national language, but it kinda does. Basically every legal document ever written in the United States is available in American. No president of the United States has not spoken American. So you see, dear reader, that it is actually quite logical to call the most spoken language in the United States, American.</p>
<p><strong>Update as of May 1, 2023</strong>: I stopped calling it "American" and became normal.</p>
