<h>How This Blog Works</h>
<p>There are three* things that happen before I got to sleep: a new blog page comes out, I watch 30 minutes of Dreaming Spanish, and I make my lunch for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I make these blogs every day. Well, I missed last night, but I will write another article today or tomorrow so that it still averages to one per day. The process of coming up with these is usually just whatever thought I have that I can write a sentence about. I don't put too much thought into this, so that is why there is a few misspellings here or there. I am really just trying to get more of a creative mind so I can write things better. The actually writing part is simple. All I have to do is make a new article and open it with Neovim. I am writing this in Neovim right now. The next step is commiting, which is what I will do as soon as I type ":wq". Then, Codeberg handles it from there. It is really neat that I don't have to pay for hosting. This website would die almost instantly if I had to host it. I will think of another article to write today, so you can expect a double article today or tomorrow.</p>
