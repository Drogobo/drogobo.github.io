<h>Cheese Theory</h>
<p>If I eat cheese before I go to bed (my favorite kind is sharp cheddar), I will have a dream (good or bad). I actually tested this with a few days of eating a hunk of cheese ~1 hour before bed. Most of these days, I had a dream. For example, last night I had some extra sharp cheddar 1.5 hours before bed, and the dream I had was very special to say the least. The thing is, I have no data to support it; I just have some silly anecdotes. If you want to try this, just know these things:</p>
<ul class="dashed">
	<li> <strong>DO NOT OVERDO IT!</strong> Seriously, if you try this, don't eat like a pound of cheese 3 minutes before bed. You could potentially get a <u>REALLY</u> terrible dream that could mess you up. Just know you are playing with fire.</li>
	<li> <strong>Rate your dream on a scale from 0 to 10.</strong> 0 on the scale is no dream, but 10 is a traumatic dream.</li>
	<li> <strong>Undertsand the variables.</strong> The two variables that can be controlled are time between eating the cheese and sleeping and then how much cheese you ate. Make sure you only modify one at a time, like a good scientist. The dependent variable is how bad the dream is.</li>
	<li> <strong>Please email me (<a href="mailto:luke@drogobo.com">luke@drogobo.com</a>) if you actually get any data on this.</strong> It would be really cool to see data on this, and humanity could probably learn a lot from this experiment.</li>
</ul>
