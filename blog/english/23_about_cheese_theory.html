<h>About Cheese Theory</h>
<p>You could consider this article to be an extension to the <a href="22_cheese_theory.html">previous article about cheese theory</a>. The theory has worked for me very much, but the stuff I get is an emotional trip. Maybe these dreams can be used to bring out your deepest problems to you so that you can understand it. If you have a dream about running out of money, that probably means you have a financial problem that needs to be addressed. I could go on about it, but I will stop it there. Personally, my dreams in cheese theory revolve around my fears and missing the bus.</p>
