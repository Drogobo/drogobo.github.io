<h>The Bomb Has Been Dropped.</h>
<p>If you look at <a href="https://codeberg.org/Drogobo/pages/commit/ab2e10ccd405bfb02b9acf3a4575d77845338bdd">the commit for this article's release</a>, you will see it has many changes to a ton of articles. That is because of a change in the writing. Up until this point, I had to say "American" instead of "English". I don't know why I had to say it, but it is just one of my lukisms. I got around to changing it all, so almost all the articles changed. Tomorrow, I will make an article about one of my lukisms, and it has to do with yes or no questions. I need to remember to link it here.</p>
