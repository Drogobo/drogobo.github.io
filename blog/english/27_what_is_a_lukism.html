<h>What is a Lukism?</h>
<p>A <em>lukism</em> is something that is unique to me. There are a few lukisms that exist, so I will explain them.</p>
<p><strong>I never know how to answer Yes/No questions.</strong> I will write an entire seperate article on this.</p>
<p><strong>I am dedicated to my current interests.</strong> Every time I try somemthing new, I will do it until I master it.</p>
<p><strong>I break a lot of things</strong> My special ability is being able to break literally anything with 5 minutes. I should go on a show and show that ability or something.</p>
