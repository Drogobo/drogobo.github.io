<h>My One-Minute Long Conversation</h>
<p>This proves the input is actually working. Today, I had a few minutes before the bell rang in Spanish class, so I walked up to my teacher and tried to speak some Spanish. I think it went really well; we talked about comprehensible input and how powerful it is. I am taking Latin next year, though, so it seemed weird that I would take Spanish at home but Latin in school. I dislike the way the teach the Spanish classes because there is NO comprehensible input. The input they will give you will either be too incomprehensible or too impractical to work, so I have just taken it upon myself.</p>
