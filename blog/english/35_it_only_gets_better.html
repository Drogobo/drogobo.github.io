<h>It Only Gets Better.</h>
<p>My conversational skills are better than projected. I have 36 hours of Dreaming Spanish right now, but the chart says I should continue cross-talking. Even though it says that, I can talk with really patient people. I have a few words in my head that I just know. Also, I kinda doubted this would work, but I can pick up tenses and other notoriously hard concepts with ease when I use comprehensible input. This makes me a STRONG supporter of comprehensible input, and I will stand behind it. Anyone who makes the hours and hours of input for any language is a saint.</p>
