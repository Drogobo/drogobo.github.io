<h>Grapejuice is Obsolete.</h>
<p>Ever since the new <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528">anticheat mechanism that Roblox introduced</a>, I have not been able to play Roblox. I didn't actually notice this until now, but it is over now. This is a pain-point in Linux now, and it really sucks for Linux users everywhere. I had Grapejuice installed for Roblox, but it seems like they are keeping their heads up. They want to breat through the limitations; I applaud them.</p>
