<h>Intuition</h>
<p>The input works. I am learning a lot of new words like he, ya, se, and as that I don't know what they quite mean, but they are slowly creating an imagine in my mind. The more I listen and take in, the easier it gets. The thing is: I am learning so slowly. Pablo says that 3 hours a day is good for a student like me, but I refuse to spend 3 whole hours a day. My max for now is probably like 1 whole hour. I promise I will ramp up the time by 1 minute per week until I get to 60 minutes in total.</p>
