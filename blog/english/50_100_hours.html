<h>100 Hours</h>
<p>I got to 100 hours a few days ago on Dreaming Spanish! I am a little late because I have 102 hours now, but more recently I finished all of the beginner videos that use Spanish from Spain. Now, I can finally watch content that is more interesting to me. I am so glad because if I didn't, then I would be stuck with really annoying videos. Intermediate is a breathe of fresh air. I have to say though, my Spanish is improving dramatically. I do 80 minutes a day now, which really accelerates the whole thing.</p>
