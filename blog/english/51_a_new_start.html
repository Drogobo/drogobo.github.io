<h>A New Start</h>
<p>I am doing it. This blog will go back to DAILY POSTS (maybe)! I still have school (I am in 9th grade now), and I am still acquiring Spanish (336 hours). This blog post hasn't seen much of me in the last few however, but I didn't die. My health is fine. I don't really know what to post about. There is this really hard research project that I have to do for school, so I might talk about that. Also, I got really into Lethal Company. I need to write that article about the yes/no questions. Other than that, I hope I can get to some new stuff.</p>
